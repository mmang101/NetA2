M Mangini A20 CS3516 Project 2: RDT3.0/ABP

Compiling with Make:
	*. run `make` or `make p2` from inside the build directory to create the project binary
	*. run the compiled binary with `./p2` in the build directory

So Make didn't succeed?:
	*. enter the 'broke' directory at './build/broke'
	*. run `gcc project2.c student2A.c  student2B.c  student2Common.c -o p2`
